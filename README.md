# Decision 

- Project is using Angular 9 and Material UI
- Routing is included during install but I am not using (just 2 routes)
- There is no store system (ngrx, ngxs...) because the app is farily small, and I believe it would be overkill.
- The folder architecture is a new structure that I wanted to test.
- There are many thing that could be improved (like caching the tweet...), but I believe it is good enough for now.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
